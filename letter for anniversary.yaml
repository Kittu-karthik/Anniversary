
I've read hundreds of novels in my life, most of them claiming that love was the center of the universe. 
That it could heal any damage inside of us. That it's what we need to survive. 
From Darcy to Heathcliff,only found in worn pages of a book. 
But that has all changed since I met my Elizabeth Bennet. 
I never thought I would be completely and utterly consumed by another until I met her.
She took my hand and lead me out of the darkness and showed me that whatever our souls are made of, 
hers and nine are the same.
You once asked who I loved the most in the world.
It's you.
